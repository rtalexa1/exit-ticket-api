# README

Much like software developers test their programs to make sure
they are working as expected, it is crucial for teachers to be
able to assess their students' learning to make sure that they are
mastering academic standards. I created this app to make it
quicker and easier for teachers to make simple assessments (known
as "exit tickets") that they can use with their students. Once
created, these exit tickets can be saved as a PDF or linked to a
teacher's Google Classroom. I wish something like this existed
when I was working in the classroom!

## Features
- Draw from a collection of standards-based (academic) and reflection questions to create exit tickets
- Save finished tickets as a PDF or share the page to Google Classroom
- Secure login with Firebase Authentication

Additional features that I would like to implement in the future include:
- Option to edit existing tickets
- Standards-based questions for additional grade levels

## Built With
- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
